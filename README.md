# Snap by OnePintWig

Welcome to my game of snap built using Cats Effect

# Game Overview
The game is broken down into 3 stages

1. Setting up the game. The players are asked to define the number of decks and the criteria around what determines a snap
2. The game then begins, with each player being prompted to press a button to turn a new card. If a snap is detected, the players will be asked to enter who called snap the first
3. Once all cards have been dealt, the winner is announced and the players are prompted for a rematch

# Requirements
* SBT

# Running the game
If running through IntelliJ - you can click the Run button directly on the Snap.scala file.

Alternatively, run through the command line using `sbt run`

# Running the tests
I would like more tests... buuut, to run the suite I have at the moment - you can run `sbt test`
